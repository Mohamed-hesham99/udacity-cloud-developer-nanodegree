# Deploy Static Website on AWS

- In this project, I deployed a static website to AWS. First, I created an ***S3 bucket*** and upload the website files to it. Next, I configured the bucket for website hosting and secured it using ***IAM policies***. Next, I speeded up content delivery using AWS content distribution network service, ***CloudFront***.


## AWS Technologies

- [CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/): Fast, highly secure and programmable content delivery network (CDN).
- [Identity and Access Management (IAM)](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/): Securely manage access to AWS services and resources.
